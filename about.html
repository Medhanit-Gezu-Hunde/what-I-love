      <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical Design</h2>
      <p>
        Mechanical design is where my love for creativity meets problem-solving. I find deep satisfaction in modeling real-world systems and devices ‚Äî from gears to structures ‚Äî that bring ideas to life. 
        It's not just about precision; it's about imagining how things move, interact, and perform in the real world. Tools like SolidWorks let me visualize concepts, simulate them, and iterate for perfection. 
        The beauty of mechanical design lies in its tangibility ‚Äî every sketch and simulation has the potential to impact how people interact with the physical world.

      <h2>üöÄ Space Exploration</h2>
      <p>
        Space represents infinite possibility. What captivates me is not just the science but the boldness of exploring the unknown. 
        The silence, the scale, the physics ‚Äî it's a vast playground for human imagination. I follow missions, track satellite launches, and read about exoplanets, not just out of interest but from a place of hope.
        Space fuels my curiosity and reminds me that the boundaries we know are only temporary. In every star, I see a question waiting to be answered and I want to be part of the search.

      <h2>üíª Coding</h2>
      <p>
        To me, coding is the most expressive tool of the digital age. With it, I can build, automate, simulate, and design from nothing but logic and vision. 
        Whether I'm creating sleek websites or writing algorithms to solve problems, I see every line of code as a form of architecture ‚Äî with structure, beauty, and intention. 
        It's the bridge between creativity and technology, and the joy of debugging, optimizing, and building keeps me constantly learning. Code isn't just syntax ‚Äî it's a language of innovation.
