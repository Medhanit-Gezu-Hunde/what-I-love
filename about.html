      <h2>‚öôÔ∏è Mechanical Design</h2>
      <p>
        Mechanical design is where my love for creativity meets problem-solving. I find deep satisfaction in modeling real-world systems and devices ‚Äî from gears to structures ‚Äî that bring ideas to life. 
        It's not just about precision; it's about imagining how things move, interact, and perform in the real world. Tools like SolidWorks let me visualize concepts, simulate them, and iterate for perfection. 
        The beauty of mechanical design lies in its tangibility ‚Äî every sketch and simulation has the potential to impact how people interact with the physical world.

      <h2>üöÄ Space Exploration</h2>
      <p>
         Space represents the ultimate unknown ‚Äî and I'm deeply drawn to that mystery. The cosmos inspires me to dream beyond boundaries, think in light-years, and stay curious. 
        Whether it's understanding orbital mechanics or reading about Mars missions, I see space as the intersection of science, wonder, and the future of humanity. It's the most honest expression of "what if?".

      <h2>üíª Coding</h2>
      <p>
         I love coding because it's like building invisible machines ‚Äî logical, creative, and expressive. With just a keyboard, I can design interactive interfaces, automate tasks, or bring stories to life on screen. 
        Whether I'm styling a webpage or learning data structures, I see programming as a superpower for turning thoughts into tools, and design into dynamic experiences.
